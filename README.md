# MAPLEAF
Syntax highlighting for .mapleaf simulation definition files
https://github.com/henrystoldt/MAPLEAF

This branch for developing a language server that suggests entries for MAPLEAF sim definition files.
Plan to base the language server on pygls: https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls
Their example server is here: https://github.com/openlawlibrary/pygls/tree/master/examples/json-extension

Code from that example server has been added into this repo, but is not yet functional.
